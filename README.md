Word Cloud

The purpose of this program is to create a visualization depicting word frequncies in the novel by Alex Haley, 
Roots: The Saga of an American Family. The bigger the word in the word cloud indicates the frequency used in the novel.

This wordcloud program reads the Roots text and creates a frequency dictionary which is used to create the word cloud using
the wordcloud package along withmatplotlib package.

* The Roots text is read into a list, line by line
* Text is stripped of punctuation, stop words and digits
* Frequency Dictionary is created
* First 300 words in the dictionary are used to create the word cloud

The image takes awhile to develop, but it looks great so be patient.
